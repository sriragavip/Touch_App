# Touch_App
👁️‍🗨️ Introducing my latest creation – an object detection and touch point accuracy app that takes user interaction to a whole new level! 📱

🔍 With the power of Machine Learning, this app can recognize and track objects in real time through the camera feed. Whether it's identifying everyday items or tracking more complex objects, this project pushes the boundaries of what's possible. 📸

✨ Features:

Precise object detection using ML
Real-time AR integration for an immersive experience
Accurate touch point tracking for enhanced interactivity
Seamless Swift OS integration
🧠 Building this project was a fantastic journey, delving into the realms of AR, ML, and Swift OS. The intersection of these technologies opens up a world of possibilities, from gaming to education to real-world applications. 🌐

🌟 I'm passionate about creating tech that not only looks cool but also serves practical purposes. What would you do with an app that can recognize and interact with objects in the real world? Share your thoughts below! 💬
